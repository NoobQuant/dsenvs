This repo contains my cookbook recipes on building custom data science environments. Focus is on using Python and R effectively via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environments.

 - *condaenv.md*: Recipes on how to build tailored `conda` environments.
 - *standalone_r.md*: How to use a standalone R installation in conjunction with NoobQuant `conda` environments.
 - *testfiles/*: Folder with Python and R examples to test environments.
